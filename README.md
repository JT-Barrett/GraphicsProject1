CS 430 Project 1: Representing P3, P6 PPM formats and conversions in C
This project is incomplete due to poor time management on my part.

The following functionalities are present:
- P3 to P6 conversion
- P6 to P3 conversion: 
-     This works for the most part when looking at the hex file of the converted file, but a bit of the data portion get's corrupted

HOW TO RUN THE PROGRAM:
- 1.navigate to the directory in console
- 2.call "make"
- 3.use the following pattern to run: 
-   ./ppmrw.exe 3 input.ppm output.ppm
- I could not figure out how to get the "./" or the .exe to disappear from the required pattern.
